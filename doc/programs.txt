External programs for reading CDs
---------------------------------


readom dev=<device> -fulltoc f=<file>

  Read the full TOC information (as returned by "READ TOC/PMA/ATIP" format 2.)
  Prints the TOC in hex on stdout, and writes it in binary to <file>.toc.
  The output on stdout does not contain the 4 byte header (2 bytes of length,
  1st session number, last session number), but the data written to the file
  does.

readom dev=<device> -clone f=<file>

  (I haven't tested this much)
  Write the full CD will all subchannel data (i.e. 2352 bytes per sector, I
  assume) to <file>.  The full TOC is written to <file>.toc

  Quite possibly could return inaccurate data for audio tracks, since they
  can't be reliably read without processing such as done by libparanoia.

icedax dev=<device> -J -v indices

  Write an audio_XX.inf file for each track.  The files will contain an
  "Index=" line, containing the sectors within the track where the indices
  change.  Also contains an "Index0=" line indicating where the pregap for the
  next track starts (the pre-gap has index 0).  Index0 will be -1 if there is
  no pre-gap.

icedax dev=<device> -J -v catalog

  Writes the usual audio_XX.inf files, but also prints the Media Catalog Number
  (MCN) on stdout.

icedax is also capable of outputting CD-TEXT information in the .inf files.
