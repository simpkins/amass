External programs for reading CDs
---------------------------------


readom dev=<device> -fulltoc f=<file>

  Read the full TOC information (as returned by "READ TOC/PMA/ATIP" format 2.)
  Prints the TOC in hex on stdout, and writes it in binary to <file>.toc.
  The output on stdout does not contain the 4 byte header (2 bytes of length,
  1st session number, last session number), but the data written to the file
  does.

readom dev=<device> -clone f=<file>

  (I haven't tested this much)
  Write the full CD will all subchannel data (i.e. 2352 bytes per sector, I
  assume) to <file>.  The full TOC is written to <file>.toc

  Quite possibly could return inaccurate data for audio tracks, since they
  can't be reliably read without processing such as done by libparanoia.
  
wodim dev=<device> -vv -toc

  Prints CD table of contents, and writes binary CD-TEXT data (if present)
  to cdtext.dat.

icedax dev=<device> -J -v all

  Write an audio_XX.inf file for each track.  In addition to normal table of
  contents information, the files also contain:

  - index information:
    The "Index=" line contains the sectors within the track where the indices
    change.  The "Index0=" line indicates where the pregap for the next track
    starts (the pre-gap has index 0, and appears after the positively-numbered
    indices for this track).  Index0 will be -1 if there is no pre-gap.

  - catalog information
    The "MCN=" line contains the Media Catalog Number, if present on the disc.

  - parsed CD-TEXT information
    Each file contains Albumperformer=, Performer=, and Albumtitle= lines
    containing information from CD-TEXT (if present).

  - ISRC information
    The ISRC= line contains the ISRC number for the track, if present.
