This is a collection of scripts for ripping audio CDs.
They aren't very user-friendly or usable at the moment.

- src/archive.py is the main ripper script

  It attempts to extract all possible data from the CD, including:
  - all audio tracks
  - all data tracks
  - any "hidden" audio data before track 1
  - CD-TEXT information, if present
  - track ISRC codes
  - intra-track indices

  It requires cdparanoia to rip the audio tracks, readom to rip the data
  tracks, and icedax to rip track index information and ISRC info.

- get_metadata.py retrieves metadata from CDDB and MusicBrainz.

- merge_metadata.py attempts to heuristically merge metadata from
  CD-TEXT, CDDB, and MusicBrainz.
