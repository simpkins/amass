Usage:

    bin2iso ARCHIVE_DIR
    bin2iso TRACK1 OFFSET1 [TRACK2 OFFSET2 ...]

This script converts data tracks from a multisession CD into a single ISO
image.  Ripping a data track from a CD does not produce a valid ISO image,
unless the track was at the very beginning of the CD.  There are two problems:

- Addresses in an ISO file system are relative to the start of the CD.  Ripping
  a data track to a file places the track contents at the start of the file, so
  the offsets from the start of the file are incorrect.

- When mounting a data CD, the operating system looks for the file system
  Volume Descriptor at the beginning of the last session.  For multi-session
  CDs, this is not at the start of the CD.  However, most tools that operate on
  ISO files always look for the Volume Descriptor at the start of the file.

This script overcomes these problems by merging all ripped data tracks into a
single file, placing them at the correct offsets in the file relative to the
start of the CD.  It also copies the Volume Descriptor that was at the start of
the last session to the start of the file.

This results in a sparse file that may appear to be as large as the original
CD, but which only has data where the data tracks exist on the CD.

Benefits and Disadvantages
--------------------------
Instead of using this approach, one could also write a script to update all
offsets in the entire filesystem so that they are relative to the start of the
file.  However, this is trickier to do correctly, since many more locations
need to be updated.  It also won't work if the CD image is using an unknown
extension in the System Area.

The current approach is much simpler, but there are downsides to using sparse
files.  Users may not realize that the file takes up less space on disk than
the actual file size, since many tools aren't good at displaying this
distinction.  Also, if you copy it, many programs will write the full copy out
to disk so that it is no longer sparse.
